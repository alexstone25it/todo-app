A todo app project which originally started small and simple as a practice project for a course. Adapting it to be used by my family, suitable for our needs.
Uses react, redux, bootstrap, reactstrap, axios.
Current plan is: 
  have various addons - called 'todoodles' - which can be added in or left out as required
  have an open "family" todoodle and a more personal closed todoodle.  Family todoodle can be accessed by all family members.  The personal todoodle can only be accessed by the user
  Other "family" members can be added in temporarily and removed
  todoodles currently on plan include:
    rota: work shifts, school, nursery times
    tasks: todo list
    shopping: need today, soon needed, weekly/monthly big shop.  Alphabetically listed which can be sorted into the local supermarket route at a button click just prior to shopping trip
    meal planner: make sure the kids dont get the same meal 3 times in a row because you don't know what your partner cooked for them the day before...
