A todo app project which originally started small and simple as a practice project for a course. Adapting it to be used by my family, suitable for our needs.
Uses react, redux, bootstrap, reactstrap, axios.
Current plan is to have various addons - called 'todoodles' - which can be added in or left out as required.
  To have an open "family" todoodle and a more personal closed todoodle.  The "family" todoodle can be accessed by all family members.  The personal todoodle can only be accessed by the user.
  Other "family" members can be added in temporarily and removed for when grandma visits.
  Todoodles currently on plan include a
    rota containing work shifts, school, nursery times;
    tasks - a todo list;
    shopping which has need today, soon needed, weekly/monthly big shop.  Alphabetically listed which can be sorted into the local supermarket route at a button click just prior to shopping trip;
    and a meal planner: make sure the kids dont get the same meal 3 times in a row because you don't know what your partner cooked for them the day before...
